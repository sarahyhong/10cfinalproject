# Final Project for PIC 10C

This is my attempt at creating a virtual lab simulation for biochemistry classes.

The following will be my work log for the rest of the quarter:

5/11/20 - I studied ways that I can start my project. I looked at lab manuals and tried to think about what I can code to create a lab simulation. So far, I have not written any code.

5/12-5/18 - I have been working to figure out how to use Qt for my final project. I had a lot of trouble with downloading and making Qt work.

5/19-6/1 - I've been struggling on my homework #2 which I hope will help with my attempt at trying to do this final project. I'm starting to get worried that I won't have enough time to start working on the code for my final project since I'm really stuck on homework #2. What I'm struggling to figure out most is how to make the overall grade be computed as I change the homework grades/exam grades. I've been making connections but it's not really working out the way I had hoped. Will give updates on this.

6/2-6/4 - I'm still having trouble with homework 2. I've been searching on google and watching some tutorials but none of them seem to give me the answer that I need. I think I might go back to working on the final project instead just to try to get something done, even if I can't really get anything to work.

6/5-6/9 - I finally learned how to add an image onto Qt! I was struggling a lot with this but I finally figured it out. I think the next step would be to try to make these objects interact with each other somehow.

6/10 - I had a lot of trouble trying to figure out how to make a label change into "Good Job!" when the user checks the right boxes and clicks OK. I will do some more research on how to do this tomorrow.

6/11-6/14 - Unfortunately, I have not figured out how to make the "OK" box work. I thought I would have more time to finish the project but I didn't get the chance... I will definitely be working on this in my own time.
