# Final Project for PIC 10C

This is my attempt at creating a virtual lab simulation for biochemistry classes.

The following will be my work log for the rest of the quarter:

5/11/20 - I studied ways that I can start my project. I looked at lab manuals and tried to think about what I can code to create a lab simulation. So far, I have not written any code.

5/12-5/18 - I have been working to figure out how to use Qt for my final project. I had a lot of trouble with downloading and making Qt work.

5/19-6/1 - I've been struggling on my homework #2 which I hope will help with my attempt at trying to do this final project. I'm starting to get worried that I won't have enough time to start working on the code for my final project since I'm really stuck on homework #2. What I'm struggling to figure out most is how to make the overall grade be computed as I change the homework grades/exam grades. I've been making connections but it's not really working out the way I had hoped. Will give updates on this.
