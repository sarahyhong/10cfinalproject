# Final Project for PIC 10C

This is my attempt at creating a virtual lab simulation for biochemistry classes.

The following will be my work log for the rest of the quarter:

5/11/20 - I studied ways that I can start my project. I looked at lab manuals and tried to think about what I can code to create a lab simulation. So far, I have not written any code.

5/12-5/18 - I have been working to figure out how to use Qt for my final project. I had a lot of trouble with downloading and making Qt work.
